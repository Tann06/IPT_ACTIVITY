            <h1>Hi, I am Tristan!</h1>
            <p>Hi, I’m Tristan Jasper Fernandez, and I’m a beginner 3D model artist currently learning the ins and outs of Blender. <br>    I’ve recently started diving into the world of 3D modeling, and I’m passionate about improving my skills every day. <br>Although I’m still in the early stages, I’m dedicated to creating better, more detailed models as I continue to grow<br> and experiment with new techniques.

                I love the process of turning ideas into 3D creations, whether it's simple objects<br> or more complex designs. I’m learning how to master everything from sculpting to texturing, and while I’m not an expert yet,<br> I’m excited to share my journey and progress. With Blender as my main tool, I’m constantly pushing myself to improve and expand<br> my knowledge.
                
                I’m excited to see where this creative path takes me, and I’m always open to feedback and new opportunities to learn</p>
